		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>
			At the beggining, I didn't planned to buy a new bike frame. I really
			liked my older frame but it had the seat tube seized... I tried
			everything to pull it out but nothing worked as wondered. During the 
			second lockdown I was still trying to save the frame from my flat but
			one day I just asked someone what was the price of the Leader Kagero 
			frameset. I liked the design and wanted to have an idea of the
			price, but after some hesitations and talks with the owner, I decided
			to buy this frameset in November.
		</p>
		<p>
			The plan was to get almost all the components that were on my old
			frame, but when I get the frameset I thought it was too nice and
			deserved better components. So I ended up spending more money than
			expected, but building a really nice bike !
