		Here is the list of the most asked question:
		<h2>Why a fixed gear ?</h2>
		There is several reasons to explain this choice :
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed gear is much more fun that geared bike !</li>
			<li>I really like the overall look of the bike, it's very pure</li>
			<li>In Paris there is no elevation so I don't need gear</li>
			<li>I like to be fast</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How light is it ?</h2>
		Around 7.5kg ! The main factors of weight saving are :
		<ul>
			<li>The frame. Mine is in alumnium but carbone is even lighter</li>
			<li>Wheelset, this one is a Miche Pistard wheelset (made for velodrome)</li>
			<li>No brakes neither gears</li>
		</ul>
